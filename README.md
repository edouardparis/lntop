`lntop` is an interactive text-mode channels viewer for Unix systems.

## Install

Require the [go programming language](https://golang.org/) (version >= 1.13)

**Raspberry Pi users: be aware that Raspbian ships with Go 1.11** ( see
[#30](https://github.com/edouardparis/lntop/issues/30) )

```
git clone https://github.com/edouardparis/lntop.git
cd lntop
go build   // creates a binary `lntop` in directory
go install // creates a binary and move it in your $GOBIN path

```

With Go version >= 1.16, you can use [`go-install`](https://golang.org/ref/mod#go-install)

```
go install github.com/edouardparis/lntop@latest
```

Note: If you are using [**Umbrel**](https://getumbrel.com) or [**Citadel**](https://runcitadel.space) you can simply install the [**Lightning Shell**](https://lightningshell.app) app from the respective dashboard. This will give you `lntop` which should just work without any additional configuration.

## Config

First time `lntop` is started, a config file `.lntop/config.toml` is created in the user's home directory. Change `address`, `cert` path and `macaroon` path according to your setup.

The following environment variables, if present, will be used in the initial config file instead of the defaults, so you won't have to have `lntop` fail on the first start and then manually edit the config file: `LND_ADDRESS`, `CERT_PATH`, `MACAROON_PATH`.

```toml
[logger]
type = "production"
dest = "/root/.lntop/lntop.log"

[network]
name = "lnd"
type = "lnd"
address = "//127.0.0.1:10009"
cert = "/root/.lnd/tls.cert"
macaroon = "/root/.lnd/data/chain/bitcoin/mainnet/readonly.macaroon"
macaroon_timeout = 60
max_msg_recv_size = 52428800
conn_timeout = 1000000
pool_capacity = 4

[network.aliases]
# Not all peers have aliases set up. In order to remember who is whom, pubkeys can be annotated.
# "Forced" aliases will be printed in a different color to be distinguished from network advertised aliases.

```

## Routing view

Routing view displays screenful of latest routing events. This information
is not persisted in LND so the view always starts empty and is lost once
you exit `lntop`.

The events are in one of four states:

* `active` - HTLC pending
* `settled` - preimage revealed, HTLC removed
* `failed` - payment failed at a downstream node
* `linkfail` - payment failed at this node

## Docker

If you prefer to run `lntop` from a docker container, `cd docker` and follow [`README`](docker/README.md) there.
